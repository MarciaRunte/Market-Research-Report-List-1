<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emergency Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volume-controlled ventilation modes</li><li>Pressure-controlled ventilation modes</li><li>Spontaneous breathing (non-invasive)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The emergency ventilator market features several key types: Volume-controlled ventilation modes ensure a set volume of air is delivered to the patient with each breath, making it predictable and consistent. Pressure-controlled ventilation modes focus on delivering air until a predetermined pressure is reached, allowing for variability based on the patient’s lung compliance. Spontaneous breathing (non-invasive) modes support patients who can initiate breaths on their own, providing supplemental oxygen while maintaining comfort and reducing the need for intubation.</p></p>
