<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Biometry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical biometry involves measuring eye dimensions to assist in diagnosing and managing vision issues. The market is segmented into two main types: contact and non-contact. Contact-type optical biometry requires direct contact with the eye, often providing precise measurements but potentially causing discomfort. In contrast, non-contact type methods eliminate the need for physical contact, employing light and imaging technology for a more patient-friendly experience. Both types serve critical roles in personalized eye care and surgical planning.</p></p>
