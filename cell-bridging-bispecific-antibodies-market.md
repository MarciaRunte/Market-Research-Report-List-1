<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cell-bridging Bispecific Antibodies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>T Cell Engagers</li><li>NK Cell Engagers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cell-bridging bispecific antibodies are designed to simultaneously engage two different types of cells, enhancing therapeutic efficacy in immuno-oncology. T cell engagers target cancer cells and T cells, promoting tumor cell destruction through T cell activation. NK cell engagers, on the other hand, direct natural killer cells to attack malignant cells, leveraging the innate immune response. Both types aim to improve cancer treatment outcomes by harnessing the body's immune system to recognize and eliminate tumors effectively.</p></p>
