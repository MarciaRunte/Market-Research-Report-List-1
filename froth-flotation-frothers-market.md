<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Froth Flotation Frothers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Active Agent</li><li>Nonsurfactant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Froth flotation is a mineral processing technique that uses frothers to enhance the separation of valuable minerals from ores. The market for froth flotation can be categorized into two main types: surface-active agents and nonsurfactants. Surface-active agents, such as alcohols and glycosides, reduce surface tension and stabilize froth, promoting bubble formation. In contrast, nonsurfactants, like polymer-based compounds, improve froth stability without altering surface tension, offering an alternative for specific flotation processes and enhancing overall efficiency in mineral recovery.</p></p>
