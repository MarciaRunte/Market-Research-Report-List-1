<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microgrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied</li><li>Independent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microgrid markets are primarily categorized into grid-tied and independent systems. Grid-tied microgrids are interconnected with the larger utility grid, allowing them to exchange power and enhance reliability during outages. They can provide services like demand response and frequency regulation. In contrast, independent microgrids operate autonomously from the main grid, often serving remote or underserved areas. These systems generate and manage their own energy, enhancing energy security and resilience, while reducing reliance on centralized power sources.</p></p>
