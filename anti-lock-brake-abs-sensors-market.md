<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-lock Brake (ABS) Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Sensor</li><li>Passive Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) Sensors market consists of two main types: active sensors and passive sensors. Active sensors generate their own signals, using a magnet and a coil, to monitor wheel speed and provide real-time data to the ABS control unit. They offer higher accuracy and responsiveness. Conversely, passive sensors rely on the magnetic field created by the rotating wheel to produce a signal. While generally less expensive, they may offer lower precision in wheel speed detection. Both types are crucial for enhancing vehicle safety and performance.</p></p>
